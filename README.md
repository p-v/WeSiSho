**We**b **Si**tes **Sho**rtcuts is a chrome extension for adding shortcuts and replaying click actions inside websites.

Save a location on a website with a sequence. Later, press the leader(default `,`) and the sequence to access the location. Each page have their own sequence, i.e. same sequence keys defined for `github` and `medium` can perform different tasks, if specified.

`h` is reserved for home. So pressing `<leader> h` will take you to the home page of the currently opened website.

Record complex click actions, like logging or opening settings, and save them to replay them later by just using few keys.
